    details: "Health disparities among elderly populations represent a critical public health challenge that demands innovative technological solutions. This project examines how 65- and olderaged adults experience significant health disparities due to a lack of accessible, personalized wellness resources tailored to their specific needs. This health inequity is exacerbated by factors such as age-related physical limitations, chronic health conditions, social isolation, technological barriers, and limited digital literacy. Our project aims to address this disparity by developing an interactive wellness app that provides personalized wellness plans, health monitoring, and community building features designed specifically for the elderly, with the goal of improving health outcomes and reducing social isolation in this vulnerable population"
